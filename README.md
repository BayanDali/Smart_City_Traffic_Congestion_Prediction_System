# IoT-Based Traffic Congestion Prediction System for Smart Cities 🚦🌐

This project presents the design and simulation of a smart traffic congestion prediction system using IoT-based data collection and machine learning techniques. Developed in Python using Jupyter Notebook, the system aims to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion in urban environments, contributing to the vision of sustainable and intelligent smart cities.

## 📌 Key Features
- Real-time traffic data simulation
- Machine learning model for congestion level prediction
- Integration of IoT principles for smart city design
- Visualizations for traffic status and predictions

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- (Optional) XGBoost / LightGBM (if used in your notebook)

## 📈 Project Objective
To demonstrate how IoT and data analytics can be combined to predict traffic congestion, enabling smarter urban planning and intelligent traffic management systems.

## 📁 Project Structure
